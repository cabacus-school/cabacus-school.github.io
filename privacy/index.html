    <h1>Privacy Policy for Cabacus</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: 29 April 2024</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy governs the privacy practices of the Cabacus mobile application ("Cabacus" or the

    <h2>In-App Purchases and Third-Party Links (if applicable)</h2>
    <p>While Cabacus currently does not offer in-app purchases or contain external links to third-party websites or

        Privacy Policy accordingly and disclose any potential data collection or sharing practices.</p>

        of the application and its content.</p>
